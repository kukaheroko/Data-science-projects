### [pisa-score_prediction](/pisa-score_prediction)
In this project I estimated a linear regression model for PISA Score
with R. 


### [skincancer-prediction](/skincancer-prediction)
In this project I estimated a logistic regression model for skin cancer
with R.


### [naiveBayes_hamORspam_example](/naiveBayes_hamORspam_example)
In this project I tested naive Bayes algorithm to classify
sms-messages to ham or spam. Example replicates the example from the
book "Machine Learning with R, authored by Brett Lantz".


### [kNN_breastcancer_example](/kNN_breastcancer_example)
In this project I tested k-nearest neighbors algorithm to classify
benign and malignant breast mass samples. Example replicates the 
example from the book "Machine Learning with R, authored by Brett Lantz".


### [loan_challenge](/loan_challenge)
In this project I tested, with python libraries, several algorithms 
to estimate a model for classifying loan applicants. Example replicates 
the example from Analytics Vidhya.
